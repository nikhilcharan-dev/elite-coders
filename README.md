## Elite Coders

Elite-Coders is an collabrative, coding platform that is built which with the vision to bridge the gap between students and coding.
It is a place where students can make of the most of it by solving coding problems across multiple plaforms, such as LeetCode, GFG, CodeChef, Codeforces and many more....
An in-built friend system helps users of elite-coders to connect, solve, and grow as coders & programmers...

It was a very funny yet mind-wrecking experience, to bring Elite-Coders to life.
